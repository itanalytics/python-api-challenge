# python-api-challenge

## Description
This project consists of two parts: WeatherPy and VacationPy.  
**WeatherPy:** Create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Use the citipy Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.  
  
**VacationPy:** Use weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, use Jupyter notebooks, Gmaps, and the Google Nearby Search API to create a heatmap with informative markers.
